<b><h2>The Thai Red Cross Society is calling on people to donate blood before the upcoming Songkran Festival,<br>
when supplies will be needed for life-saving medical services.</b></h2>
<h2>>As millions of people usually travel during the Songkran holidays, 
There is a greater risk of road accidents and large numbers of &nbsp&nbspcasualties.
<br><br>>The Songkran road toll is expected to be so high that the relevant agencies have resolved to declare the holiday
period <br>&nbsp&nbsp<font color= "red">"Seven Dangerous Days" </font> in order to promote road safety.<br><br>

<br><br>>The experience of the past, however, is that adequate blood stocks will be needed to help save lives. 
<br><br>>At least one hospital already has critically low blood supplies.
<br><br>>Thai Red Cross Society, which operates the National Blood Centre,
said this week that almost 200 hospitals had asked for blood units.
<br><br>>On their requests, "we will have to provide between 3,000 and 4,000 blood units per day during Songkran,” an official said.
<br><br>>The Red Cross said that, statistically, group O is the most in-demand blood type, followed by B, A, and AB.
<br><br>>During the seven days of Songkran, at least about 28,000 blood units will be required in storage.
<br><br>>People who plan to go on vacation during this period are advised to donate blood beforehand.
