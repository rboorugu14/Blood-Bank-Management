<h1><font color= "red" size="30px">Why should one donate blood?</font></h1>
<p>Each year, thousands of people rely on receiving donated blood and blood products to stay alive.
Certain injuries and illnesses can quickly cause a person's blood levels to drop.
Without enough blood, they will not receive enough oxygen in their body, resulting in death.
Many hospitals and medical centers utilize donated blood to save the lives of their patients.
<b>While a blood donation can be vital for some people.</b><br><b>1.W</b>hat are the effects on those who donate the blood?
<br>Here, you can take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of giving blood.</p>
<h1><font color= "darkblue" size="20px">TYPES OF BLOOD:</font></h1>

<h1><font color= "red" size="7px">Advantages:</font></h1>
<p>While donated blood is beneficial for people in need,
some medical professionals maintain that donating blood also benefits the donor.</p>
<p style: text-align="center"><b>1.)Reduces iron levels: </b>
Iron is a mineral that the body needs to produce red blood cells.
However, too much &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspiron can be harmful to a person's health.
It can deposit into different organs of the body, such as the liver  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand heart, and affect the way those organs function.

<br><b>2.)</b>Identifies adverse health effects
<br><b>3.)</b>Becoming a blood donor is a generous thing to do, and provides essential blood for the medical industry.
<br><b>4.)</b>Each person who donates blood completes a simply physical examination and short blood test before giving &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblood.

<br><b>5.)</b>As a result, it is possible that a person could identify unknown health concerns as a part of the blood &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdonation process.
These health issues could include blood pressure concerns or low blood counts.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough, low blood counts would stop a person from donating,
discovering this information could help them &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppursue more information about their health.

<br><b>6.)</b>Helps people feel good about themselves
<br><b>7.)</b>Donating blood has the power to impact up to three people who need the blood to survive.<br><br></p>
<h1><font color= "red" size="7px">Disadvantages:</font></h1>
<p>When performed in a clean manner, donating blood is safe.
<br>
If a blood bank were to reuse needles,
this could increase the risk of someone experiencing a blood-borne infection.
<br>
For this reason,
it is part of routine blood collection to use new needles for each donation and to require every person
involved to wash their hands.
<br>
The United States Food and Drug Administration monitors blood banks to make sure they are collecting blood safely.
<br>
A person can experience some side effects, as a result of donating blood. These include: <br>

1) dizziness <br>
2) feeling weak <br>
3) light head ache <br>
4) nausea <br>
These symptoms will usually go away within 3 days of giving blood.
<br>
If a person's iron levels seem to be too low after a blood donation,
they can increase their intake of iron-filled foods.
Foods with high iron content include red meat,spinach and iron-fortified juices and cereals.</p>
<h2><font color= "red" size="10px">DON'Ts:</font></h2>
<p>1.)A person should never use donating blood to find out if they have any blood-borne diseases,
such as hepatitis &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspB, hepatitis C, or HIV. Instead, they should always go to their doctor with any concerns they have.</p>
<h2><font color="red" size="10px">What do we expect from you?</font></h2>
<p>
1.) Come prepared. <br>
2.) Have a light meal and plenty to drink. <br>
3.) Bring your donor card, driver's license or two other forms of identification. <br>
4.) Bring the names of medications you are taking. <br>
